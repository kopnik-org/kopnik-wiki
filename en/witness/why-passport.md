# What Kopnik does with passport data

With the help of passport data (name, year of birth, 4 last digits of the passport), Kopnik uniquely identifies each user.

# Why is it important

Just as one person cannot exist in two bodies in real life, in Kopnik there cannot be two accounts for one community member. Protection against duplicate accounts prevents rogues under different names from registering as one hundred different community members, linking these fake community members into one fake community, thus giving birth to elders of arbitrary rank. Such fake petty officers, having flooded Kopnik, would make him unsuitable for the intended purposes. This is due to the fact that in Kopnik, no more than 10 elders with the highest ranks are always displayed on the map, and such fake elders, overshadowing the real elders of real communities, would make Kopnik unusable as a tool for unification.

# How does the protection against duplicate accounts work?

Each participant can get into the network only by confirming the full name + year of birth + 4 last digits of the passport of their state. This combination uniquely identifies every person on the planet. When you try to create a second account, the network checks for similar data and blocks re-registration.

# What goals is NOT pursued by Copnik
