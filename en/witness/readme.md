# What is the certification procedure

The certification procedure is a technical procedure that is not directly related to the Copyright, during which the authenticity of the user's personal data is verified.

# Why is it important

There are three critical tasks that the assurance procedure performs:

1. [Preventing the emergence of fake communities and fake elders](why-passport.md)
2. [Creation of real (not virtual) communities on earth on a territorial basis](why-placement.md)
3. [Obstacle to the passage of crooks into mop men](why-family.md)

Without solving these problems, Kopnik will never become an effective tool for a shock unification and will not cope with the task of world Slavic unification assigned to him.

# How does the assurance work?

1. First, the Witness will get acquainted with the personal data of the new user.
2. Then the witness will ask the user to prove: 2.1. Passport to confirm name, age, last 4 digits and place of residence. 2.2. If the user has applied for the role of a hooded husband, then it is also necessary to confirm the family.
3. The user will provide the requested evidence to the Witness.
4. Having received evidence, the Witness will make a conclusion about the authenticity of the user's personal data.
5. Finally, on the basis of the conclusion, the Witness will accept you into Copnik or not.

# What goals is NOT pursued by Copnik

- Transfer of personal data to third parties

# What if I disagree
