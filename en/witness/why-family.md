# What Kopnik does with marital status information

Kopnik uses information about the marital status of the community members in order to give them the authority of a mop husband.

# Why is it important

In Kopnaya Pravo, the unification and management of the community occurs exclusively through the mop husbands. All other members of the community, like children, wives, elderly parents, entrust these responsibilities to the husbands of the cops and are themselves represented through them.

Digging men are selected in the community according to the well-known set of personal qualities that were outlined by Sergei Danilov and Alexei Trekhlebov: home, household, family and children.

If we assume that information about marital status is not requested and not certified, instead of real mop husbands, Kopnik will be flooded with impostors: dozens of impostors with heightened self-esteem about their management abilities will come running for every true mop husband.

All these impostors obscure the true mop husbands, complicating their mutual search and interaction, because the number of impostors is much greater, and only 10 copniks are always displayed on the Copnik map. If you have presented, then you will agree that in such a state, Copnik would cease to be an effective tool for a shock unification.

# How protection from impostors works

Each participant who has applied for the role of a hooded husband and a hooded husband (relaxed requirements for Sergey Danilov) provides evidence of a spouse, a child, a job and a household. In the absence of one of these criteria or refusal to provide evidence, registration is rejected or it is proposed to choose a role with less authority. Only the cops on the web have the authority of the cops of the Coop Right.

# What goals is NOT pursued by Copnik
