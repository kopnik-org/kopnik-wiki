# What Kopnik does with his place of actual residence

The place of actual residence of the community member is displayed on the map to the neighboring community members.

# Why is it important

Information about the location is necessary for the community members for mutual search on the ground, establishing contacts and uniting into communities on a territorial basis (house, yard, city, region). Without localization, such communities would be replaced by imaginary Internet communities.

# How the search works by territory

Each participant indicates the place of permanent residence during registration. The network stores the location of all members and displays them on a map. Thus, each participant sees community members living in the neighborhood, as well as communities located nearby. Communities that have formed at the local level from single participants see other communities located nearby and thus get the opportunity to establish interaction and unification through the elders. This creates a simple, universal way to build loner communities -&gt; home -&gt; yard -&gt; city -&gt; region, etc.
